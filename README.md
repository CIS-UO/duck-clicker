Pilot - how hard would it be to build a simple classroom response system

UO currently uses iClicker, and will be changing to iClicker Cloud,
requiring students to purchase an iClicker subscription.  Do we really
need a commercial classroom response system?   Could the features we require
be provided by a simple web app with a mobile interface?
